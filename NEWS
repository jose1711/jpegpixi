Version 1.1.1:
* Fixed typo in English jpegpixi manual page.
* Updated postal address of the Free Software Foundation.

Version 1.1.0:
* In addition to hot pixels in an otherwise black image, the `jpeghotp'
  program can now also find dead pixels in an otherwise white image.
* Fail gracefully if the locale cannot be set.

Version 1.0.3:
* Stephan Peccini <stephan@tesenca.info> has contributed French
  translations of the manual pages and the message catalog. Thank
  you, Stephan!

Version 1.0.2:
* Spelling mistakes in the German message catalog have been corrected.
* Minor cleanup of the code and build infrastructure. Split some
  messages to make the job of translators easier.

Version 1.0.1:
* Jarno Elonen <elonen@iki.fi> has contributed Finnish translations of
  the manual pages and the message catalog. Thank you, Jarno!

Version 1.0.0:
* Native Language Support is provided. The package contains a message
  catalog with German translations.
* With Native Language Support, all intended features are implemented.
  Therefore, the major version number is changed to 1.

Version 0.16.0:
* German translations of the manual pages are provided. This is the
  first step towards Native Language Support in the programs themselves.

Version 0.15.1:
* Following a proposal on the debian-legal mailinglist (see
  <http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/05/msg00150.html> and
  followups), license information (i.e. the output shown if the
  `--version' command line option is specified) is put into a separate
  section `.license' in the executable, if possible.  The contents of
  this section can be dumped with the GNU binutils, using the command:
  objcopy -O binary -j .license /path/to/jpegpixi `tty`
* Bug fix: Link with math library (-lm) if necessary.

Version 0.15.0:
* The `jpegpixi' program has a new command line option `--verbose' to
display coordinates and sizes of interpolated pixel blocks.
* Bug fix: Warn if overlapping pixel blocks are specified.
* Bug fix: Consolidate adjacent pixel blocks. For example, if `42,17'
and `43,17' are specified, the behavior is the same as if `42,17,2,1'
had been specified instead.
* Bug fix: Work correctly in extreme cases where almost the whole image
is interpolated.

Version 0.14.2:
* The `jpeghotp' program can output comments with the luminosities of
the hot pixel blocks. This can be helpful in "hand tuning" the pixel
blocks file.

Version 0.14.1:
* Jarno Elonen <elonen@iki.fi> will maintain the jpegpixi Debian package;
therefore the `debian' directory has been removed.

Version 0.14:
* A new program `jpeghotp' is provided. It finds hot pixels in an
otherwise black JPEG image.
* Spelling mistakes in the manual page corrected.

Version 0.13:
* Coordinates and sizes can not only be specified as absolute values, but
also as percentages of the image size.

Version 0.12:
* Jpegpixi now parses command line options with code generated with `opag',
an option parser generator by the same author. This has no user-visible effect.

Version 0.11:
* No code changes at all. The only purpose of this release is to incorporate
a change of the home page and the author's e-mail address.

Version 0.10:
* Pixel block specifications can be read from a file (in addition to
the command line).

Version 0.9:
* In addition to 2-dimensional interpolation, 1-dimensional interpolation is
now also supported. The latter can be used to remove horizontal or vertical
stripes which span the whole image or a large part of it. Thanks to Evgeny
Stambulchik for suggesting this.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.8:
* The size of the block to be interpolated is now only limited by available
memory.
* Jpegpixi does no longer use precalculated tables for the interpolation;
this reduces the size of the executable.
* Especially for low-quality images, the (inevitable) quality loss in the
vicinity of interpolated pixels is now even smaller. To achieve this, the
optimal threshold for the rounding of DCT coefficients has been empirically
determined.
* Huffman tables are re-calculated for the output image, resulting in a
smaller file size in some cases.
* It is no longer possible to print debugging output. Maintaining this
functionality is too much of a hassle for too little benefit.

Version 0.7:
* Bug fix: Pixels near the image edges are treated correctly.
* More verbose debugging output.
* Uses automake 1.7.5.

Version 0.6:
* The package uses autoconf 2.57 and automake 1.7.2.
* A `debian' subdirectory to build a Debian package is provided.

Version 0.5:
* There is now a manual page.
* The maximum size of the pixel block to be interpolated has been
increased to 5x5 pixels.
* The package uses automake 1.6.1.

Version 0.4:
* Biquadratic and bicubic interpolation are supported in addition to
averaging and bilinear interpolation.

Version 0.3:
* The size of the pixel block to be interpolated can be specified
(up to 3x3 pixels).
* Interpolation engine rewritten from scratch. Averaging and bilinear
interpolation are available as interpolation methods. Quadratic
interpolation has been taken out and will be added again to a later
version. CAUTION: The names of the interpolation methods (`-m' option)
have changed.

Version 0.2:
* Bug fixes. Now jpegpixi works reasonably well with low quality JFIF
images.
* New command line option `-d' to display debugging information (e.g.
the DCT coefficients before and after the interpolation).
* Interpolation method can be specified on the command line. The
following methods are supported:
  - average of 4 adjacent pixels
  - average of 8 surrounding pixels
  - quadratic surface defined by 12 nearest pixels

Version 0.1:
* First release.
